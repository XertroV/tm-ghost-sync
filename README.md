# Ghost Sync

### Requires MLHook and MLFeed -- you must also install those plugins or this will not work!

When you respawn, ghosts will be sync'd to your no-respawn time.

Say a ghost is .3 ahead of you when you go through a CP. If you respawn at that CP, the ghost will be rewound so that it is still .3 ahead of you.

Works in solo mode only (similar to ghost scrubber).
