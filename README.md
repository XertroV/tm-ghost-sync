# Ghost Sync

### Requires MLHook and MLFeed -- you must also install those plugins or this will not work!

#### Default mode: sync to no-respawn time

When you respawn, ghosts will be sync'd to your no-respawn time.

Say a ghost is .3 ahead of you when you go through a CP. If you respawn at that CP, the ghost will be rewound so that it is still .3 ahead of you.

#### Alternate mode: sync to checkpoint.

When you pass through a CP, or respawn, then all ghosts will be re-sync'd to pass through the checkpoint at the same time you do. (Similar to the partial PB ghost that shows up after a respawn.)

#### General

Works in solo mode only (similar to ghost scrubber).

Big thanks to Isirix for the request / idea / suggestion.
